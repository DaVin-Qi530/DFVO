DFVO: Learning Darkness-free Visible and Infrared Image Disentanglement and Fusion All at Once
## Framework
![The architecture of our DFVO method. Dashed lines represent the data-flow for hidden i-stage, and solid lines represent the data-flow for hidden ii-stage. The feature extraction module serves both hidden tasks (illumination enhancement & image fusion) in a shared manner.](https://github.com/DaVin-Qi530/DFVO/blob/master/Figure/Framework.jpg)
## FEM Architecture
![The details of the modules. (left) Interaction details of the cross-attention module. (right) Specific blocks of the details-extraction module.](https://github.com/DaVin-Qi530/DFVO/blob/master/Figure/Modules.jpg)

## About Code
This paper is currently under review. We will open-source it as soon as it is accepted for publication.
