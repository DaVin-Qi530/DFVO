## Network Structure
![framework](https://github.com/DaVin-Qi530/DFVO/blob/master/Figures/Framework.jpg)
The overall architecture of our method. The parallel cascaded tasks include the infrared image-reconstruction task, illumination disentanglement task, and image fusion task. (a) The specific structure of the Details-Extraction Module, which aims to capture high-frequency features from the source images. (b) The architecture of the Hyper Cross-Attention Module, which is designed to obtain the low-frequency features.
## LCFE Architecture
